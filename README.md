# VSB daily bulletin parser & scraper

My kids school posts a useful daily bulletin on their website which I rarely remember to check.

Based on a quick google it appears a number of other VSB High Schools have a similar daily bulletin page.

This is an incomplete project to scrape VSB daily bulletin pages so I can generate a notification of some kind and keep an archive of recent posts.

I plan to run this periodically using a serverless platform in the future so for now I am sticking to the standard python library.
